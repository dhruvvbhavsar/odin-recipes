Hello Future Dhruv,

We started learning Web Development in Mar 2022 frim The-Odin-Project. We're doing great progress I suppose. We learned a lot of things in the way. Without knowing the how-tos of web development, they taught us first how to be a better programmer. Command line basics, introducton and the history of Git. How to Update the git repo and how to write good commit messages. I hope you're using these lessons wisely.

In this project, we would be building a website for Recipes! Using Lists, Elements and Tags, and Most using The anchor <a> Tag for referencing the page with links to other web pages. and lastly i learned how to add images to websites. I hope this ends well. I will finish this after I finish the project
