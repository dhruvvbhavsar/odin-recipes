    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Making Pizza is easy but it is not a fast recipe because it takes some time for you to marinate and
        grill the paneer. Next make the gravy and then finish the dish. If you are an experienced cook and can
        multi-task between the grilling and making the tikka masala you will finish the dish fast.</p>



    <p>But if you are a newbie you can make the gravy ahead and refrigerate. Simply grill the tikkas and reheat the
        tikka masala on the day you intend to serve it.</p>



    <p>This recipe is vegetarian and gluten-free. To make it vegan you can substitute paneer with tofu and use any vegan
        yogurt. You may also skip the cream and use more cashews or almonds to compensate for the creaminess.</p>



    <p>For a nut-free option, you can leave out the cashews completely but you will miss the creamy texture in your
        tikka masala. So the better option is to substitute cashews with more heavy cream as mentioned in the recipe
        notes. In India a lot of people use poppy seeds or magaz seeds as a substitute for cashews you may try that as
        well.</p>
